# 11056-Project-2First request:
build a one page website using html and css about homebrew beer

Result: Very, very simple page, but still clean and efficient. Much easier than coding from scratch. The images however had broken links, but a second request to fix this did not work. Response was:
I apologize for that. As a language model, I don't have control over external images and their links, so I used a random image from Unsplash for the sake of example. Here's an updated code with the image link updated to a different image:
The CSS coded was embedded in the HTML as a <style> element. I will request this be split into a CSS file in future iterations.

The actual information sourced for the content was actually really useful and informative about the hobby. 

2nd request:
can you add colums to the page to make it more visually interesting
I asked it to add columns to make the page more visually appealing. 2 colums were added quickly, but it still remained a very basic page. Images were still not loading.
The footer has also been dropped.
It actually looks like sections of the code have been dropped froom the response. Regenerating code to see if this adds the required elements.

2.5 request:
can you add a subscribe button to the footer
There seems to be a limit on the length of this request. I requested the code be split into styles.CSS and index.HTML files. This worked well and allowed separation of the CSS and HTML.

3rd request:
can you please split the code into a styles.css file and an index.html file
There is a limit on the response length from the system. The Index.html was fine, but the Styles.CSS truncated after a couple of lines, as shown below:.
/* CSS styles */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
header {
  background-color: #333;
3.5 request	
can you regenrate the styles.css
Regenerating the Styles.CSS returned a complete CSS file. This 

Notes:
It seems to regenerate new content each time I request a change. Will need to modify my requests to just request specific changes from now.

4th request:
can you add grid element for the columns
Columns don’t seem to be working. Requested it use grid layout to generate the content mapping.
This vastly changed the page, the colour scheme has changed and the look was different. The grid elements meant the images and text looked much cleaner. This is a big improvement.


5th request:
can you suggest some images to download for the page
response:
Sure, here are some suggestions for images related to homebrewing that you could use on your webpage:

- A person pouring a homebrewed beer into a glass
- A close-up of hops or barley
- A person stirring a pot of boiling wort
- A row of filled beer bottles
- A homebrewing kit with all the necessary equipment
- A person holding a glass of beer with a homebrewing logo on it
- A group of people enjoying a homebrewed beer outdoors

You can search for these images on stock photo websites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Shutterstock, or on free image search engines like Google Images. Just make sure to check the usage rights and give proper credit to the photographer if required.


Notes:
Really good explanations when asking specific questions about code:
In this example, I've used the font-size: 4vw; property to set the font size of the hero text to 4% of the viewport width. This means that the font size will scale up or down depending on the size of the screen, allowing the text to fit within the hero image on any device. You can adjust the 4vw value to your liking.

 These explanations allowed the code to be added, just need to choose the size to suit. This is much easier than custom cutting code, only need to worry about making the result look good.


Used it to clean up the styles.css file…
